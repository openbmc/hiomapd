# HIOMAP: The Host I/O Mapping Protocol for Power-based Systems

This repository contains
[the specification for the Power systems Host I/O mapping protocol (HIOMAP)](Documentation/protocol.md)
along with a reference implementation of the daemon and associated utilities.

For historical reasons, source and generated binaries may refer to 'mbox' or
'the mailbox interface' in contexts that aren't completely sensible. It's
unfortunate, but it's our current reality.

# Building

The build system is a standard autotools setup. `bootstrap.sh` runs all the jobs
necessary to initialise autotools.

By default the build is configured and built _with_ the 'virtual PNOR' feature
discussed below. The virtual PNOR functionality is written in C++, and due to
some autotools clunkiness even if it is disabled mboxd will still be linked with
`CXX`.

If you are hacking on the reference implementation it's recommended to run
`bootstrap.sh` with the `dev` argument:

```
$ ./bootstrap.sh dev
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
```

This will turn on several of the compiler's sanitizers to help find bad memory
management and undefined behaviour in the code via the test suites.

Otherwise, build with:

```
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
```

Through the virtual PNOR feature the daemon's role as a flash abstraction can be
augmented to support partition/filesystem abstraction. This is complex and
unnecessary for a number of platforms, and so the feature can be disabled at
`configure` time. If you do not have a C++ compiler for your target, set
`CXX=cc`.

```
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure CXX=cc --disable-virtual-pnor
$ make
$ make check
```

# Coding Style Guide

## Preamble

For not particularly good reasons the codebase is a mix of C and C++. This is an
ugly split: message logging and error handling can be vastly different inside
the same codebase. The aim is to remove the split one way or the other over time
and have consistent approaches to solving problems.

However, the current reality is the codebase is developed as part of OpenBMC's
support for Power platforms, which leads to integration of frameworks such as
[phosphor-logging](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-logging). It's noted that
with phosphor-logging we can achieve absurd duplication or irritating splits in
where errors are reported, as the C code is not capable of making use of the
interfaces provided.

So:

## Rules

1. Message logging MUST be done to stdout or stderr, and MUST NOT be done
   directly via journal APIs or wrappers of the journal APIs.

   Rationale:

   We have two scenarios where we care about output, with the important
   restriction that the method must be consistent between C and C++:

   1. Running in-context on an OpenBMC-based system
   2. Running the test suite

   In the first case it is desirable that the messages appear in the system
   journal. To this end, systemd will by default capture stdout and stderr of
   the launched binary and redirect it to the journal.

   In the second case it is _desirable_ that messages be captured by the test
   runner (`make check`) for test failure analysis, and it is _undesirable_ for
   messages to appear in the system journal (as these are tests, not issues
   affecting the health of the system they are being executed on).

   Therefore direct calls to the journal MUST be avoided for the purpose of
   message logging.

   Note: This section specifically targets the use of phosphor-logging's
   `log<T>()`. It does not prevent the use of `elog<T>()`.
