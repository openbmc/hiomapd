Right now you have no code even contributed to the repository, so it seems a bit of a stretch to make you an OWNER.\n\nI would suggest that we:\n\n1. Ask Andrew to remove himself if that is what he is interested in.  Likely Deepak should be removed as well since I don\u0027t think he has any further interest in this repository.\n\n2. Replace Adriana as the OWNER and add Ninad as a reviewer for a period of time (3-6 months).  After sufficient development and/or reviews have been done, Adriana can promote Ninad as an OWNER (and step down herself if she wants).",
